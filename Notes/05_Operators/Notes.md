# 📝 C Operators

## 1. Arithmetic Operators ➕➖
```c
+  Addition        (5 + 3 = 8)
-  Subtraction     (5 - 3 = 2)
*  Multiplication  (5 * 3 = 15)
/  Division        (10 / 3 = 3)   // Integer division
%  Modulus         (10 % 3 = 1)   // Remainder
```

## 2. Relational Operators 
```c
==  Equal to           (5 == 5 → 1)
!=  Not equal          (5 != 3 → 1)
>   Greater than       (7 > 3 → 1)
<   Less than          (2 < 5 → 1)
>=  Greater or equal   (5 >= 5 → 1)
<=  Less or equal      (4 <= 3 → 0)
```

## 3. Logical Operators 
```c
&&  AND  (both must be true)
||  OR   (at least one true)
!   NOT  (reverses the result)
```

## 4. Assignment Operators 
```c
=   Simple assignment  (a = 5)
+=  Add and assign     (a += 2 → a = a + 2)
-=  Subtract and assign
*=  Multiply and assign
/=  Divide and assign
%=  Modulus and assign
```

## 5. Increment/Decrement ⬆️⬇️
```c
a++  Post-increment  (use then increase)
++a  Pre-increment   (increase then use)
a--  Post-decrement
--a  Pre-decrement
```

## 6. Bitwise Operators
```c
&   AND    (5 & 3 = 1)
|   OR     (5 | 3 = 7)
^   XOR    (5 ^ 3 = 6)
~   NOT    (~5 = -6)
<<  Left shift  (5 << 1 = 10)
>>  Right shift (5 >> 1 = 2)
```

## 7. Special Operators 
```c
sizeof()  // Returns size in bytes
?:        // Ternary operator (short if-else)
```

## Tips:
- **%** gives remainder → great for checking even/odd
- **++a** vs **a++** → matters in expressions
- **&&** stops checking if first condition is false
- **||** stops checking if first condition is true
- Use **parentheses** when unsure about precedence!
